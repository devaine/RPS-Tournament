remember:
- app/ = application interface
- components/ = those are tools for app/
- features/ = functionality, uses tools to serve a purpose for app/
- styles/ = custom types for each part of the application (components, more specifically)
- types/ = for shared types used across the application

- components work indepdendent of features, features rely on components to do something
